I decided to take the time that working from home has given me to refocus on my FrontEnd skills.  While I am still having to work my regular job, I have an opportunity to take the time that I would normally be waiting traveling to improve on my skills.  The easiest way to do this is by focusing on my portfolio which will include my projects.  

The projects that I will be including in my portfolio will be BlocJams, BlocFlix, BlocChat, and Bloc To-Do.  I will also have a blog section which I will discuss any challenges that I have encountered.

### BlocJams
BlocJams is a music player that was created using React.  It depicts the album covers that are available for the user's to chose with the title, artists name(s), and other album information. Once the album is chosen it will show the songs that are available for that album as well as associated information for each song. The song will allow the user to play, scroll through the song, pause, stop, and move forward and backward to the next track.  It will also allow the user to adjust the volume of the song.

### BlocFlix
Here's an example of what BlocFlix looks like.  It is a rudimentary version of NetFlix in which the user is able to browse movies:

### BlocChat
BlocChat is an app that permits users to communicate with others. The app utilizes __*Firebase*__ which is a **Backend as a Service (BaaS)** that is provided for use by [__Google__](https://firebase.google.com/ "Google Firebase"). User's are able to create an account which will be used to sign into the chat rooms. The chat app stores the user information for access later. Users are allowed to create new chatrooms to be accessed as needed.

### Bloc To-Do
Bloc To-Do is a simple app which allows for the user to create a list of items that need to be created.  The user will be able to check the item once it is completed and to delete, or remove, at a later time.

These are the core projects that I worked on as part of the [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io/) bootcamp.  It helped lay the foundations for my coding path.  I will continue my pursuit to further my education and look forward to what this path may bring.
