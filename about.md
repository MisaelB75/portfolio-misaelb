I am not the typical person that you would expect to be starting a coding career. The previous languages that I was learning to use was QBasic and Turbo Pascal. I continued to dabble with computers the years but never immersed myself in any one IT area.  I have recently had the opportunity to seek a new career and have decided that this is the time to follow this passion of mine.

I started this path haphazardly by taking a coding [FrontEnd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) bootcamp at [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io) which helped me gain a better insight into how ill prepared I was. I have continued my education after the bootcamp by taking additional courses through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/user/f9991a23ad9d8a984e5d22e0982d8521) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/misaelb).  Some of the things that I have learned thus far are:

- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [GitHub](https://lab.github.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

I will continue to update this site as I further my education and experience into coding.  Let me know if there is something that you would like to know about me.
