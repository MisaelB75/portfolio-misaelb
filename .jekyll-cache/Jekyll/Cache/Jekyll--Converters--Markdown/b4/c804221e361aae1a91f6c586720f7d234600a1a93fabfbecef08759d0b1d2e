I"_<p>I decided to take the time that working from home has given me to refocus on my FrontEnd skills.  While I am still having to work my regular job, I have an opportunity to take the time that I would normally be waiting traveling to improve on my skills.  The easiest way to do this is by focusing on my portfolio which will include my projects.</p>
