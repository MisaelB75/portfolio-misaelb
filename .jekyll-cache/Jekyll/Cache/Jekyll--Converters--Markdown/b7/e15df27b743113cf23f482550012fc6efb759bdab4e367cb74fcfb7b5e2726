I"<p>I decided to take the time that working from home has given me to refocus on my FrontEnd skills.  While I am still having to work my regular job, I have an opportunity to take the time that I would normally be wating traveling to improve on my skills.  The easiest way to do this is by focusing on my portfolio which will include my projects.</p>

<p>The projects that I will be including in my portfolio will be Bloc Jams, Bloc Flix, Bloc Chat, and Bloc To-Do.  I will also have a blog section which I will discuss any challenges that I have encountered.</p>

<p>Bloc Jams</p>

<p>((What is it?))</p>

<p>Bloc Flix</p>

<p>((What is it?))</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Bloc Chat</script>

<p>Bloc To-Do</p>

<p>Jeykll supports the use of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.</p>

<p>Tables have also been extended from Markdown:</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an example of an image, which is included using Markdown:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blocflix.png" alt="Geometric pattern with fading gradient" /></p>

<p>Type Theme uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as <script type="math/tex">S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}</script> can be displayed inline.</p>

<p>Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2}</script>
