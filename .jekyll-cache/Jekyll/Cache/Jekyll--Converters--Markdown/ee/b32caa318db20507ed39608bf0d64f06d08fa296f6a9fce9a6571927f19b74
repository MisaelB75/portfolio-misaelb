I"]<p>I am not the typical person that you would expect to be starting a coding career. The previous languages that I was learning to use was QBasic and Turbo Pascal. I continued to dabble with computers the years but never immersed myself in any one IT area.  I have recently had the opportunity to seek a new career and have decided that this is the time to follow this passion of mine.</p>

<p>I started this path haphazardly by taking a coding FrontEnd bootcamp at (Bloc.io)[“https://www.bloc.io”] which helped me gain a better insight into how ill prepared I was. I have continued my education after the bootcamp by taking additional courses through Coursera and Codecademy.  Some of the things that I have learned thus far are:
Javascript
React
GitHub
Python</p>
