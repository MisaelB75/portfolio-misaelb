I"P<p>I am not the typical person that you would expect to be starting a coding career. The previous languages that I was learning to use was QBasic and Turbo Pascal. I continued to dabble with computers the years but never immersed myself in any one IT area.  I have recently had the opportunity to seek a new career and have decided that this is the time to follow this passion of mine.</p>

<p>I started this path haphazardly by taking a coding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">FrontEnd</a> bootcamp at <a href="https://www.bloc.io">Bloc.io</a> which helped me gain a better insight into how ill prepared I was. I have continued my education after the bootcamp by taking additional courses through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/user/f9991a23ad9d8a984e5d22e0982d8521">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/misaelb">Codecademy</a>.  Some of the things that I have learned thus far are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Javascript</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://lab.github.com/">GitHub</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I will continue to update this site as I further my education and experience into coding.  Let me know if there is something that you would like to know about me.</p>
