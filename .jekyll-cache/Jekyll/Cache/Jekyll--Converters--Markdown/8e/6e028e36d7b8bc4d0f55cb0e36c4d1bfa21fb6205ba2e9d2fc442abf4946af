I"4<p>I decided to take the time that working from home has given me to refocus on my FrontEnd skills.  While I am still having to work my regular job, I have an opportunity to take the time that I would normally be wating traveling to improve on my skills.  The easiest way to do this is by focusing on my portfolio which will include my projects.</p>

<p>The projects that I will be including in my portfolio will be Bloc Jams, Bloc Flix, Bloc Chat, and Bloc To-Do.  I will also have a blog section which I will discuss any challenges that I have encountered.</p>

<h3 id="bloc-flix">Bloc Flix</h3>
<p>Here’s an example of what BlocFlix looks like.  It is a rudimentary version of NetFlix in which the user is able to browse movies:</p>

<h3 id="blocchat">BlocChat</h3>
<p>BlocChat is an app that permits users to communicate with others. The app utilizes <em>Firebase</em> which is a <strong>Backend as a Service (BaaS)</strong> that is provided to be used by Google. User’s are able to create an account whch will be used to sign into the chat rooms. The chat app stores the user information for access later. 
Users are allowed to create new chatrooms to be accessed as needed.</p>

<p>Jeykll supports the use of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.</p>
